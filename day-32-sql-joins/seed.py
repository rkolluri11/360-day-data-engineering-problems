"""Shared seed data for Day 32: a company database with four tables,
built for JOIN lessons.

Day 31 had one table; JOINs need at least two, and the interesting
lessons need deliberate mismatches. This dataset has them:

- employees: Day 31's 12, plus Nina Patel in "Legal" — a department
  with NO row in departments (dropped by INNER JOIN, kept by LEFT).
- departments: 5 rows, including "Operations" — a department with NO
  employees (dropped by INNER JOIN, kept by RIGHT/FULL).
- projects: 4 rows, including "Delta" — a project with NO assignments.
- assignments: 8 rows linking employees to projects (many-to-many).
  Alice and Carol each hold 2 assignments — the fanout demo.
- project_tags: Apollo carries 2 tags — the double-count trap demo.

``create_company_db`` returns a fresh in-memory connection per call,
so tests stay independent.
